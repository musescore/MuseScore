- Add declarative API
- Fix bug where no tab would be highlighted



TROUBLESHOOTING
===============

- Very rarely, in some Nvidia/X11 setups, floating/docking has noticeable lag (like 1 second)
  This could be solved by going to Nvidia's settings and making sure all monitors have
  the same refresh rate and disabling "Allow Flipping". It's not known why this solves it. Might also
  be a bug in Qt.
