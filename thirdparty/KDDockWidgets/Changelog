* v1.4.0 (unreleased)
  - Experimental MDI support. By using MainWindowMDI you can now have "docked" dock widgets
    which are free to be arbitrarily positioned and even overlapped inside the main window.
  - TitleBar's height is now controlled by sizeHint() instead of hardcoded.
    If you haven't overridden TitleBar or just inheriting from TitleBarWidget then there's nothing to do,
    as TitleBarWidget already reimplements sizeHint. If you're inheriting directly from TitleBar then make
    sure to provide a sizeHint.
  - Added MainWindow::closeDockWidgets()
  - Fixed crash in MainWindow::layoutEqually()
  - QtQuick: Added more declarative API
  - FloatingWindow now honours the dockwidget's max-size, if there's a single
    dock widget docked. Tabbed cases are more difficult since QStackedLayout doesn't
    propagate size constraints.
  - Added MainWindowBase::frameCountChanged()
  - Introduced Config::setDropIndicatorsInhibited(), which allows you to disable support
  for drop indicators while dragging.

* v1.3.1 (unreleased)
  - Improve restoring layout when RestoreOption_RelativeToMainWindow is used (#171)

  - Double clicking a native title bar of a Qt::Tool window will now redock the window (#173)

    resizes its content accordingly (#174)

  - Don't restore maximized state when using RestoreOption_RelativeToMainWindow (#184)

  - Installs a version header (kddockwidgets_version.h) that defines a version string and other useful versioning macros (#138)
  - DockWidgetBase::eventFilter() is protected instead of private (regression vs v1.1) (#148)
    It's recommended that you rebuild your application when updating KDDW, as MSVC encodes private/protected in the name mangling.
