# Doxyfile 1.8.10

# This file describes the settings to be used by the documentation system
# doxygen (www.doxygen.org) for a project.
#
# All text after a double hash (##) is considered a comment and is placed in
# front of the TAG it is preceding.
#
# All text after a single hash (#) is considered a comment and will be ignored.
# The format is:
# TAG = value [value, ...]
# For lists, items can also be appended using:
# TAG += value [value, ...]
# Values that contain spaces should be placed between quotes (\" \").

# Only non-default options are included below to improve portability
# between doxygen versions.
#
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Project related configuration options
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The PROJECT_NAME tag is a single word (or a sequence of words surrounded by
# double-quotes, unless you are using Doxywizard) that should identify the
# project for which the documentation is generated. This name is used in the
# title of most generated pages and in a few other places.
# The default value is: My Project.

PROJECT_NAME           = Opus

# The PROJECT_NUMBER tag can be used to enter a project or revision number. This
# could be handy for archiving the generated documentation or if some version
# control system is used.

PROJECT_NUMBER         = @VERSION@

# Using the PROJECT_BRIEF tag one can provide an optional one line description
# for a project that appears at the top of each page and should give viewer a
# quick idea about the purpose of the project. Keep the description short.

PROJECT_BRIEF          = "Opus audio codec (RFC 6716): API and operations manual"

# With the PROJECT_LOGO tag one can specify a logo or an icon that is included
# in the documentation. The maximum height of the logo should not exceed 55
# pixels and the maximum width should not exceed 200 pixels. Doxygen will copy
# the logo to the output directory.

PROJECT_LOGO           =

# If the FULL_PATH_NAMES tag is set to YES, doxygen will prepend the full path
# before files name in the file list and in the header files. If set to NO the
# shortest path that makes the file name unique will be used
# The default value is: YES.

FULL_PATH_NAMES        = NO

# If the JAVADOC_AUTOBRIEF tag is set to YES then doxygen will interpret the
# first line (until the first dot) of a Javadoc-style comment as the brief
# description. If set to NO, the Javadoc-style will behave just like regular Qt-
# style comments (thus requiring an explicit @brief command for a brief
# description.)
# The default value is: NO.

JAVADOC_AUTOBRIEF      = YES

# The TAB_SIZE tag can be used to set the number of spaces in a tab. Doxygen
# uses this value to replace tabs by spaces in code fragments.
# Minimum value: 1, maximum value: 16, default value: 4.

TAB_SIZE               = 8

# Set the OPTIMIZE_OUTPUT_FOR_C tag to YES if your project consists of C sources
# only. Doxygen will then generate output that is more tailored for C. For
# instance, some of the names that are used will be different. The list of all
# members will be omitted, etc.
# The default value is: NO.

OPTIMIZE_OUTPUT_FOR_C  = YES

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Build related configuration options
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# If the EXTRACT_ALL tag is set to YES, doxygen will assume all entities in
# documentation are documented, even if no documentation was available. Private
# class members and static file members will be hidden unless the
# EXTRACT_PRIVATE respectively EXTRACT_STATIC tags are set to YES.
# Note: This will also disable the warnings about undocumented members that are
# normally produced when WARNINGS is set to YES.
# The default value is: NO.

EXTRACT_ALL            = YES

# If the EXTRACT_PRIVATE tag is set to YES, all private members of a class will
# be included in the documentation.
# The default value is: NO.

EXTRACT_PRIVATE        = NO

# If the CASE_SENSE_NAMES tag is set to NO then doxygen will only generate file
# names in lower-case letters. If set to YES, upper-case letters are also
# allowed. This is useful if you have classes or files whose names only differ
# in case and if your file system supports case sensitive file names. Windows
# and Mac users are advised to set this option to NO.
# The default value is: system dependent.

CASE_SENSE_NAMES       = YES

# The ENABLED_SECTIONS tag can be used to enable conditional documentation
# sections, marked by \if <section_label> ... \endif and \cond <section_label>
# ... \endcond blocks.

ENABLED_SECTIONS       =

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration options related to warning and progress messages
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The QUIET tag can be used to turn on/off the messages that are generated to
# standard output by doxygen. If QUIET is set to YES this implies that the
# messages are off.
# The default value is: NO.

QUIET                  = YES

# The WARNINGS tag can be used to turn on/off the warning messages that are
# generated to standard error (stderr) by doxygen. If WARNINGS is set to YES
# this implies that the warnings are on.
#
# Tip: Turn warnings on while writing the documentation.
# The default value is: YES.

WARNINGS               = YES

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration options related to the input files
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The INPUT tag is used to specify the files and/or directories that contain
# documented source files. You may enter file names like myfile.cpp or
# directories like /usr/src/myproject. Separate the files or directories with
# spaces. See also FILE_PATTERNS and EXTENSION_MAPPING
# Note: If this tag is empty the current directory is searched.

INPUT                  = @top_srcdir@/include/opus.h \
                         @top_srcdir@/include/opus_types.h \

                         @top_srcdir@/include/opus_custom.h

# The EXCLUDE tag can be used to specify files and/or directories that should be
# excluded from the INPUT source files. This way you can easily exclude a
# subdirectory from a directory tree whose root is specified with the INPUT tag.
#
# Note that relative paths are relative to the directory from which doxygen is
# run.

EXCLUDE                =

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration options related to the alphabetical class index
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# If the ALPHABETICAL_INDEX tag is set to YES, an alphabetical index of all
# compounds will be generated. Enable this if the project contains a lot of
# classes, structs, unions or interfaces.
# The default value is: YES.

ALPHABETICAL_INDEX     = NO

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration options related to the HTML output
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The HTML_HEADER tag can be used to specify a user-defined HTML header file for
# each generated HTML page. If the tag is left blank doxygen will generate a
# standard header.
#
# To get valid HTML the header file that includes any scripts and style sheets
# that doxygen needs, which is dependent on the configuration options used (e.g.
# the setting GENERATE_TREEVIEW). It is highly recommended to start with a
# default header using
# doxygen -w html new_header.html new_footer.html new_stylesheet.css
# YourConfigFile
# and then modify the file new_header.html. See also section "Doxygen usage"
# for information on how to generate the default header that doxygen normally
# uses.
# Note: The header is subject to change so you typically have to regenerate the
# default header when upgrading to a newer version of doxygen. For a description
# of the possible markers and block names see the documentation.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

HTML_HEADER            = @top_srcdir@/doc/header.html

# The HTML_FOOTER tag can be used to specify a user-defined HTML footer for each
# generated HTML page. If the tag is left blank doxygen will generate a standard
# footer. See HTML_HEADER for more information on how to generate a default
# footer and what special commands can be used inside the footer. See also
# section "Doxygen usage" for information on how to generate the default footer
# that doxygen normally uses.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

HTML_FOOTER            = @top_srcdir@/doc/footer.html

# The HTML_STYLESHEET tag can be used to specify a user-defined cascading style
# sheet that is used by each HTML page. It can be used to fine-tune the look of
# the HTML output. If left blank doxygen will generate a default style sheet.
# See also section "Doxygen usage" for information on how to generate the style
# sheet that doxygen normally uses.
# Note: It is recommended to use HTML_EXTRA_STYLESHEET instead of this tag, as
# it is more robust and this tag (HTML_STYLESHEET) will in the future become
# obsolete.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

HTML_STYLESHEET        = @top_srcdir@/doc/customdoxygen.css

# The HTML_EXTRA_FILES tag can be used to specify one or more extra images or
# other source files which should be copied to the HTML output directory. Note
# that these files will be copied to the base HTML output directory. Use the
# $relpath^ marker in the HTML_HEADER and/or HTML_FOOTER files to load these
# files. In the HTML_STYLESHEET file, use the file name only. Also note that the
# files will be copied as-is; there are no commands or markers available.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

HTML_EXTRA_FILES       = @top_srcdir@/doc/opus_logo.svg

# The HTML_COLORSTYLE_SAT tag controls the purity (or saturation) of the colors
# in the HTML output. For a value of 0 the output will use grayscales only. A
# value of 255 will produce the most vivid colors.
# Minimum value: 0, maximum value: 255, default value: 100.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

HTML_COLORSTYLE_SAT    = 0

# If the HTML_TIMESTAMP tag is set to YES then the footer of each generated HTML
# page will contain the date and time when the page was generated. Setting this
# to YES can help to show when doxygen was last run and thus if the
# documentation is up to date.
# The default value is: NO.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

HTML_TIMESTAMP         = YES

# When MathJax is enabled you need to specify the location relative to the HTML
# output directory using the MATHJAX_RELPATH option. The destination directory
# should contain the MathJax.js script. For instance, if the mathjax directory
# is located at the same level as the HTML output directory, then
# MATHJAX_RELPATH should be ../mathjax. The default value points to the MathJax
# Content Delivery Network so you can quickly see the result without installing
# MathJax. However, it is strongly recommended to install a local copy of
# MathJax from http://www.mathjax.org before deployment.
# The default value is: http://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest.
# This tag requires that the tag USE_MATHJAX is set to YES.

MATHJAX_RELPATH        = https://www.mathjax.org/mathjax

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration options related to the LaTeX output
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The PAPER_TYPE tag can be used to set the paper type that is used by the
# printer.
# Possible values are: a4 (210 x 297 mm), letter (8.5 x 11 inches), legal (8.5 x
# 14 inches) and executive (7.25 x 10.5 inches).
# The default value is: a4.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_LATEX is set to YES.

PAPER_TYPE             = letter

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration options related to the man page output
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# If the GENERATE_MAN tag is set to YES, doxygen will generate man pages for
# classes and files.
# The default value is: NO.

GENERATE_MAN           = YES

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration options related to the preprocessor
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# If the MACRO_EXPANSION tag is set to YES, doxygen will expand all macro names
# in the source code. If set to NO, only conditional compilation will be
# performed. Macro expansion can be done in a controlled way by setting
# EXPAND_ONLY_PREDEF to YES.
# The default value is: NO.
# This tag requires that the tag ENABLE_PREPROCESSING is set to YES.

MACRO_EXPANSION        = YES

# If the EXPAND_ONLY_PREDEF and MACRO_EXPANSION tags are both set to YES then
# the macro expansion is limited to the macros specified with the PREDEFINED and
# EXPAND_AS_DEFINED tags.
# The default value is: NO.
# This tag requires that the tag ENABLE_PREPROCESSING is set to YES.

EXPAND_ONLY_PREDEF     = YES

# The INCLUDE_PATH tag can be used to specify one or more directories that
# contain include files that are not input files but should be processed by the
# preprocessor.
# This tag requires that the tag SEARCH_INCLUDES is set to YES.

INCLUDE_PATH           =

# The PREDEFINED tag can be used to specify one or more macro names that are
# defined before the preprocessor is started (similar to the -D option of e.g.
# gcc). The argument of the tag is a list of macros of the form: name or
# name=definition (no spaces). If the definition and the "=" are omitted, "=1"
# is assumed. To prevent a macro definition from being undefined via #undef or
# recursively expanded use the := operator instead of the = operator.
# This tag requires that the tag ENABLE_PREPROCESSING is set to YES.

PREDEFINED             = OPUS_EXPORT= \
                         OPUS_CUSTOM_EXPORT= \

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration options related to the dot tool
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# If you set the HAVE_DOT tag to YES then doxygen will assume the dot tool is
# available from the path. This tool is part of Graphviz (see:
# http://www.graphviz.org/), a graph visualization toolkit from AT&T and Lucent
# Bell Labs.

# Debian defaults to YES here, while Fedora and Homebrew default to NO.
# So we set this based on whether the graphviz package is available at
# configure time.
