    \class QtSingleApplication qtsingleapplication.h
    \brief The QtSingleApplication class provides an API to detect and
    communicate with running instances of an application.

    This class allows you to create applications where only one
    instance should be running at a time. I.e., if the user tries to
    launch another instance, the already running instance will be
    activated instead. Another usecase is a client-server system,
    where the first started instance will assume the role of server,
    and the later instances will act as clients of that server.

    By default, the full path of the executable file is used to
    determine whether two processes are instances of the same
    application. You can also provide an explicit identifier string
    that will be compared instead.

    The application should create the QtSingleApplication object early
    in the startup phase, and call isRunning() or sendMessage() to
    find out if another instance of this application is already
    running. Startup parameters (e.g. the name of the file the user
    wanted this new instance to open) can be passed to the running
    instance in the sendMessage() function.

    If isRunning() or sendMessage() returns false, it means that no
    other instance is running, and this instance has assumed the role
    as the running instance. The application should continue with the
    initialization of the application user interface before entering
    the event loop with exec(), as normal. The messageReceived()
    signal will be emitted when the application receives messages from
    another instance of the same application.

    If isRunning() or sendMessage() returns true, another instance is
    already running, and the application should terminate or enter
    client mode.

    If a message is received it might be helpful to the user to raise
    the application so that it becomes visible. To facilitate this,
    QtSingleApplication provides the setActivationWindow() function
    and the activateWindow() slot.

    Here's an example that shows how to convert an existing
    application to use QtSingleApplication. It is very simple and does
    not make use of all QtSingleApplication's functionality (see the
    examples for that).

    \code
    // Original
    int main(int argc, char **argv)
    {
        QApplication app(argc, argv);

        MyMainWidget mmw;

        mmw.show();
        return app.exec();
    }

    // Single instance
    int main(int argc, char **argv)
    {
        QtSingleApplication app(argc, argv);

        if (app.isRunning())
            return 0;

        MyMainWidget mmw;

        app.setActivationWindow(&mmw);

        mmw.show();
        return app.exec();
    }
    \endcode

    Once this QtSingleApplication instance is destroyed(for example,
    when the user quits), when the user next attempts to run the
    application this instance will not, of course, be encountered. The
    next instance to call isRunning() or sendMessage() will assume the
    role as the new running instance.

    For console (non-GUI) applications, QtSingleCoreApplication may be
    used instead of this class, to avoid the dependency on the QtGui
    library.
