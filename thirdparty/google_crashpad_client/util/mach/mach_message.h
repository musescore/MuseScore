//! While deadlines exist on an absolute time scale, timeouts are relative. This

//!
//! If \a timeout_ms is #kMachMessageDeadlineNonblocking, this function will

MachMessageDeadline MachMessageDeadlineFromTimeout(

//! \brief Runs `mach_msg()` with a deadline, as opposed to a timeout.
//!
//! This function is similar to `mach_msg()`, with the following differences:
//!  - The `timeout` parameter has been replaced by \a deadline. The deadline
//!    applies uniformly to a call that is requested to both send and receive
//!    a message.
//!  - The `MACH_SEND_TIMEOUT` and `MACH_RCV_TIMEOUT` bits in \a options are
//!    not used. Timeouts are specified by the \a deadline argument.
//!  - The `send_size` parameter has been removed. Its value is implied by
//!    \a message when \a options contains `MACH_SEND_MSG`.
//!  - The \a run_even_if_expired parameter has been added.
//!
//! Like the `mach_msg()` wrapper in `libsyscall`, this function will retry
//! operations when experiencing `MACH_SEND_INTERRUPTED` and
//! `MACH_RCV_INTERRUPTED`, unless \a options contains `MACH_SEND_INTERRUPT` or
//! `MACH_RCV_INTERRUPT`. Unlike `mach_msg()`, which restarts the call with the
//! full timeout when this occurs, this function continues enforcing the
//! user-specified \a deadline.
//!
//! Except as noted, the parameters and return value are identical to those of
//! `mach_msg()`.
//!
//! \param[in,out] message
//! \param[in] options
//! \param[in] receive_size

//! \param[in] deadline The time by which this call should complete. If the
//!     deadline is exceeded, this call will return `MACH_SEND_TIMED_OUT` or
//!     `MACH_RCV_TIMED_OUT`.
//! \param[in] notify_port
//! \param[in] run_even_if_expired If `true`, a deadline that is expired when
//!     this function is called will be treated as though a deadline of
//!     #kMachMessageDeadlineNonblocking had been specified. When `false`, an
//!     expired deadline will result in a `MACH_SEND_TIMED_OUT` or
//!     `MACH_RCV_TIMED_OUT` return value, even if the deadline is already
//!     expired when the function is called.
