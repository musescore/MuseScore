// Use ScopedMachVM to supervise ownership of pages in the current process
// through the Mach VM subsystem. Pages allocated with vm_allocate can be
// released when exiting a scope with ScopedMachVM.
//
// The Mach VM subsystem operates on a page-by-page basis, and a single VM
// allocation managed by a ScopedMachVM object may span multiple pages. As far
// as Mach is concerned, allocated pages may be deallocated individually. This
// is in contrast to higher-level allocators such as malloc, where the base
// address of an allocation implies the size of an allocated block.
// Consequently, it is not sufficient to just pass the base address of an
// allocation to ScopedMachVM, it also needs to know the size of the
// allocation. To avoid any confusion, both the base address and size must
// be page-aligned.
//
// When dealing with Mach VM, base addresses will naturally be page-aligned,
// but user-specified sizes may not be. If there's a concern that a size is
// not page-aligned, use the mach_vm_round_page macro to correct it.
//
// Example:
//
//   vm_address_t address = 0;
//   vm_size_t size = 12345;  // This requested size is not page-aligned.
//   kern_return_t kr =
//       vm_allocate(mach_task_self(), &address, size, VM_FLAGS_ANYWHERE);
//   if (kr != KERN_SUCCESS) {
//     return false;
//   }
//   ScopedMachVM vm_owner(address, mach_vm_round_page(size));
