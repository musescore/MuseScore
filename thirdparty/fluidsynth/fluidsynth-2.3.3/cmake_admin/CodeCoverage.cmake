# CHANGES:
#
# 2012-01-31, Lars Bilke
# - Enable Code Coverage
#
# 2013-09-17, Joakim SÃ¶derberg
# - Added support for Clang.
# - Some additional usage instructions.
#
# 2016-02-03, Lars Bilke
# - Refactored functions to use named parameters
#
# 2017-06-02, Lars Bilke
# - Merged with modified version from github.com/ufz/ogs
#
# 2019-05-06, Anatolii Kurotych
# - Remove unnecessary --coverage flag
#
# 2019-12-13, FeRD (Frank Dana)
# - Deprecate COVERAGE_LCOVR_EXCLUDES and COVERAGE_GCOVR_EXCLUDES lists in favor
#   of tool-agnostic COVERAGE_EXCLUDES variable, or EXCLUDE setup arguments.
# - CMake 3.4+: All excludes can be specified relative to BASE_DIRECTORY
# - All setup functions: accept BASE_DIRECTORY, EXCLUDE list
# - Set lcov basedir with -b argument
# - Add automatic --demangle-cpp in lcovr, if 'c++filt' is available (can be
#   overridden with NO_DEMANGLE option in setup_target_for_coverage_lcovr().)
# - Delete output dir, .info file on 'make clean'
# - Remove Python detection, since version mismatches will break gcovr
# - Minor cleanup (lowercase function names, update examples...)
#
# 2019-12-19, FeRD (Frank Dana)
# - Rename Lcov outputs, make filtered file canonical, fix cleanup for targets
#
# 2020-01-19, Bob Apthorpe
# - Added gfortran support
#
# 2020-02-17, FeRD (Frank Dana)
# - Make all add_custom_target()s VERBATIM to auto-escape wildcard characters
#   in EXCLUDEs, and remove manual escaping from gcovr targets
#
# 2021-01-19, Robin Mueller
# - Add CODE_COVERAGE_VERBOSE option which will allow to print out commands which are run
# - Added the option for users to set the GCOVR_ADDITIONAL_ARGS variable to supply additional
#   flags to the gcovr command
#
# 2020-05-04, Mihchael Davis
#     - Add -fprofile-abs-path to make gcno files contain absolute paths
#     - Fix BASE_DIRECTORY not working when defined
#     - Change BYPRODUCT from folder to index.html to stop ninja from complaining about double defines
# USAGE:
#
# 1. Copy this file into your cmake modules path.
#
# 2. Add the following line to your CMakeLists.txt (best inside an if-condition
#    using a CMake option() to enable it just optionally):
#      include(CodeCoverage)
#
# 3. Append necessary compiler flags:
#      append_coverage_compiler_flags()
#
# 3.a (OPTIONAL) Set appropriate optimization flags, e.g. -O0, -O1 or -Og
#
# 4. If you need to exclude additional directories from the report, specify them
#    using full paths in the COVERAGE_EXCLUDES variable before calling
#    setup_target_for_coverage_*().
#    Example:
#      set(COVERAGE_EXCLUDES
#          '${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/src/dir1/*'
#          '/path/to/my/src/dir2/*')
#    Or, use the EXCLUDE argument to setup_target_for_coverage_*().
#    Example:
#      setup_target_for_coverage_lcov(
#          NAME coverage
#          EXECUTABLE testrunner
#          EXCLUDE "${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/src/dir1/*" "/path/to/my/src/dir2/*")
#
# 4.a NOTE: With CMake 3.4+, COVERAGE_EXCLUDES or EXCLUDE can also be set
#     relative to the BASE_DIRECTORY (default: PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR)
#     Example:
#       set(COVERAGE_EXCLUDES "dir1/*")
#       setup_target_for_coverage_gcovr_html(
#           NAME coverage
#           EXECUTABLE testrunner
#           BASE_DIRECTORY "${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/src"
#           EXCLUDE "dir2/*")
#
# 5. Use the functions described below to create a custom make target which
#    runs your test executable and produces a code coverage report.
#
# 6. Build a Debug build:
#      cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
#      make
#      make my_coverage_target
#
