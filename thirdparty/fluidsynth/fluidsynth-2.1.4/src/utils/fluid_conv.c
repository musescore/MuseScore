/*
 * Converts absolute cents to Hertz
 * 
 * As per sfspec section 9.3:
 * 
 * ABSOLUTE CENTS - An absolute logarithmic measure of frequency based on a
 * reference of MIDI key number scaled by 100.
 * A cent is 1/1200 of an octave [which is the twelve hundredth root of two],
 * and value 6900 is 440 Hz (A-440).
 * 
 * Implemented below basically is the following:
 *   440 * 2^((cents-6900)/1200)
 * = 440 * 2^((int)((cents-6900)/1200)) * 2^(((int)cents-6900)%1200))
 * = 2^((int)((cents-6900)/1200)) * (440 * 2^(((int)cents-6900)%1200)))
 *                                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 *                           This second factor is stored in the lookup table.
 *
 * The first factor can be implemented with a fast shift when the exponent
 * is always an int. This is the case when using 440/2^6 Hz rather than 440Hz
 * reference.
