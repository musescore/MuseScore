%description
FluidSynth is a real-time software synthesizer based on the SoundFont
2 specifications. FluidSynth can read MIDI events from MIDI input
devices and render them to audio devices using SoundFont files to
define the instrument sounds. It can also play MIDI files and supports
real time effect control via SoundFont modulators and MIDI
controls. FluidSynth can be interfaced to other programs in different
ways, including linking as a shared library.
