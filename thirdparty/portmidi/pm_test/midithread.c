/* midithread.c -- example program showing how to do midi processing 
                   in a preemptive thread

  Notes: if you handle midi I/O from your main program, there will be
  some delay before handling midi messages whenever the program is
  doing something like file I/O, graphical interface updates, etc.

  To handle midi with minimal delay, you should do all midi processing
  in a separate, high priority thread. A convenient way to get a high
  priority thread in windows is to use the timer callback provided by
  the PortTime library. That is what we show here.

  If the high priority thread writes to a file, prints to the console,
  or does just about anything other than midi processing, this may 
  create delays, so all this processing should be off-loaded to the
  "main" process or thread. Communication between threads can be tricky.
  If one thread is writing at the same time the other is reading, very
  tricky race conditions can arise, causing programs to behave
  incorrectly, but only under certain timing conditions -- a terrible
  thing to debug. Advanced programmers know this as a synchronization
  problem. See any operating systems textbook for the complete story.

  To avoid synchronization problems, a simple, reliable approach is
  to communicate via messages. PortMidi offers a message queue as a
  datatype, and operations to insert and remove messages. Use two 
  queues as follows: midi_to_main transfers messages from the midi
  thread to the main thread, and main_to_midi transfers messages from
  the main thread to the midi thread. Queues are safe for use between
  threads as long as ONE thread writes and ONE thread reads. You must 
  NEVER allow two threads to write to the same queue.

  This program transposes incoming midi data by an amount controlled
  by the main program. To change the transposition, type an integer
  followed by return. The main program sends this via a message queue
  to the midi thread. To quit, type 'q' followed by return.

  The midi thread can also send a pitch to the main program on request.
  Type 'm' followed by return to wait for the next midi message and
  print the pitch.

  This program illustrates:
    Midi processing in a high-priority thread.
    Communication with a main process via message queues.
