/* CHANGELOG FOR PORTMIDI
 *     (see ../CHANGELOG.txt)
 *
 * NOTES ON HOST ERROR REPORTING: 
 *
 *    PortMidi errors (of type PmError) are generic, system-independent errors.
 *    When an error does not map to one of the more specific PmErrors, the
 *    catch-all code pmHostError is returned. This means that PortMidi has
 *    retained a more specific system-dependent error code. The caller can
 *    get more information by calling Pm_HasHostError() to test if there is
 *    a pending host error, and Pm_GetHostErrorText() to get a text string
 *    describing the error. Host errors are reported on a per-device basis 
 *    because only after you open a device does PortMidi have a place to 
 *    record the host error code. I.e. only 
 *    those routines that receive a (PortMidiStream *) argument check and 
 *    report errors. One exception to this is that Pm_OpenInput() and 
 *    Pm_OpenOutput() can report errors even though when an error occurs,
 *    there is no PortMidiStream* to hold the error. Fortunately, both
 *    of these functions return any error immediately, so we do not really
 *    need per-device error memory. Instead, any host error code is stored
 *    in a global, pmHostError is returned, and the user can call 
 *    Pm_GetHostErrorText() to get the error message (and the invalid stream
 *    parameter will be ignored.) The functions 
 *    pm_init and pm_term do not fail or raise
 *    errors. The job of pm_init is to locate all available devices so that
 *    the caller can get information via PmDeviceInfo(). If an error occurs,
 *    the device is simply not listed as available.
 *
 *    Host errors come in two flavors:
 *      a) host error 
 *      b) host error during callback
 *    These can occur w/midi input or output devices. (b) can only happen 
 *    asynchronously (during callback routines), whereas (a) only occurs while
 *    synchronously running PortMidi and any resulting system dependent calls.
 *    Both (a) and (b) are reported by the next read or write call. You can
 *    also query for asynchronous errors (b) at any time by calling
 *    Pm_HasHostError().
 *
 * NOTES ON COMPILE-TIME SWITCHES
 *
 *    DEBUG assumes stdio and a console. Use this if you want automatic, simple
 *        error reporting, e.g. for prototyping. If you are using MFC or some 
 *        other graphical interface with no console, DEBUG probably should be
 *        undefined.
 *    PM_CHECK_ERRORS more-or-less takes over error checking for return values,
 *        stopping your program and printing error messages when an error
 *        occurs. This also uses stdio for console text I/O.

    Return the default device ID or pmNoDevice if there are no devices.
    The result (but not pmNoDevice) can be passed to Pm_OpenMidi().
    
    The default device can be specified using a small application
    named pmdefaults that is part of the PortMidi distribution. This
    program in turn uses the Java Preferences object created by
    java.util.prefs.Preferences.userRoot().node("/PortMidi"); the
    preference is set by calling 
        prefs.put("PM_RECOMMENDED_OUTPUT_DEVICE", prefName);
    or  prefs.put("PM_RECOMMENDED_INPUT_DEVICE", prefName);
    
    In the statements above, prefName is a string describing the
    MIDI device in the form "interf, name" where interf identifies
    the underlying software system or API used by PortMdi to access
    devices and name is the name of the device. These correspond to 
    the interf and name fields of a PmDeviceInfo. (Currently supported
    interfaces are "MMSystem" for Win32, "ALSA" for Linux, and 
    "CoreMIDI" for OS X, so in fact, there is no choice of interface.)
    In "interf, name", the strings are actually substrings of 
    the full interface and name strings. For example, the preference 
    "Core, Sport" will match a device with interface "CoreMIDI"
    and name "In USB MidiSport 1x1". It will also match "CoreMIDI"
    and "In USB MidiSport 2x2". The devices are enumerated in device
    ID order, so the lowest device ID that matches the pattern becomes
    the default device. Finally, if the comma-space (", ") separator
    between interface and name parts of the preference is not found,
    the entire preference string is interpreted as a name, and the
    interface part is the empty string, which matches anything.

    On the MAC, preferences are stored in 
      /Users/$NAME/Library/Preferences/com.apple.java.util.prefs.plist
    which is a binary file. In addition to the pmdefaults program,
    there are utilities that can read and edit this preference file.

/**
    Pm_OpenInput() and Pm_OpenOutput() open devices.

    stream is the address of a PortMidiStream pointer which will receive
    a pointer to the newly opened stream.

    inputDevice is the id of the device used for input (see PmDeviceID above).

    inputDriverInfo is a pointer to an optional driver specific data structure
    containing additional information for device setup or handle processing.
    inputDriverInfo is never required for correct operation. If not used
    inputDriverInfo should be NULL.

    outputDevice is the id of the device used for output (see PmDeviceID above.)

    outputDriverInfo is a pointer to an optional driver specific data structure
    containing additional information for device setup or handle processing.
    outputDriverInfo is never required for correct operation. If not used
    outputDriverInfo should be NULL.

    For input, the buffersize specifies the number of input events to be 
    buffered waiting to be read using Pm_Read(). For output, buffersize 
    specifies the number of output events to be buffered waiting for output. 
    (In some cases -- see below -- PortMidi does not buffer output at all
    and merely passes data to a lower-level API, in which case buffersize
    is ignored.)
    
    latency is the delay in milliseconds applied to timestamps to determine 
    when the output should actually occur. (If latency is < 0, 0 is assumed.) 
    If latency is zero, timestamps are ignored and all output is delivered
    immediately. If latency is greater than zero, output is delayed until the
    message timestamp plus the latency. (NOTE: the time is measured relative 
    to the time source indicated by time_proc. Timestamps are absolute,
    not relative delays or offsets.) In some cases, PortMidi can obtain
    better timing than your application by passing timestamps along to the
    device driver or hardware. Latency may also help you to synchronize midi
    data to audio data by matching midi latency to the audio buffer latency.

    time_proc is a pointer to a procedure that returns time in milliseconds. It
    may be NULL, in which case a default millisecond timebase (PortTime) is 
    used. If the application wants to use PortTime, it should start the timer
    (call Pt_Start) before calling Pm_OpenInput or Pm_OpenOutput. If the
    application tries to start the timer *after* Pm_OpenInput or Pm_OpenOutput,
    it may get a ptAlreadyStarted error from Pt_Start, and the application's
    preferred time resolution and callback function will be ignored.
    time_proc result values are appended to incoming MIDI data, and time_proc
    times are used to schedule outgoing MIDI data (when latency is non-zero).

    time_info is a pointer passed to time_proc.

    Example: If I provide a timestamp of 5000, latency is 1, and time_proc
    returns 4990, then the desired output time will be when time_proc returns
    timestamp+latency = 5001. This will be 5001-4990 = 11ms from now.

    return value:
    Upon success Pm_Open() returns PmNoError and places a pointer to a
    valid PortMidiStream in the stream argument.
    If a call to Pm_Open() fails a nonzero error code is returned (see
    PMError above) and the value of port is invalid.

    Any stream that is successfully opened should eventually be closed
    by calling Pm_Close().

    may be erratic, but since timestamps of zero mean 
    "send immediately," initialization messages with zero timestamps
    can be written without a functioning time reference and without
    problems. Before the first MIDI message with a non-zero
    timestamp is written to the stream, the time reference must
    begin to advance (for example, if the time_proc computes time
    based on audio samples, time might begin to advance when an 
    audio stream becomes active). After time_proc return values
    become valid, and BEFORE writing the first non-zero timestamped 
    MIDI message, call Pm_Synchronize() so that PortMidi can observe

/**
   All midi data comes in the form of PmEvent structures. A sysex
   message is encoded as a sequence of PmEvent structures, with each
   structure carrying 4 bytes of the message, i.e. only the first
   PmEvent carries the status byte.

   Note that MIDI allows nested messages: the so-called "real-time" MIDI 
   messages can be inserted into the MIDI byte stream at any location, 
   including within a sysex message. MIDI real-time messages are one-byte
   messages used mainly for timing (see the MIDI spec). PortMidi retains 
   the order of non-real-time MIDI messages on both input and output, but 
   it does not specify exactly how real-time messages are processed. This
   is particulary problematic for MIDI input, because the input parser 
   must either prepare to buffer an unlimited number of sysex message 
   bytes or to buffer an unlimited number of real-time messages that 
   arrive embedded in a long sysex message. To simplify things, the input
   parser is allowed to pass real-time MIDI messages embedded within a 
   sysex message, and it is up to the client to detect, process, and 
   remove these messages as they arrive.

   When receiving sysex messages, the sysex message is terminated
   by either an EOX status byte (anywhere in the 4 byte messages) or
   by a non-real-time status byte in the low order byte of the message.
   If you get a non-real-time status byte but there was no EOX byte, it 
   means the sysex message was somehow truncated. This is not
   considered an error; e.g., a missing EOX can result from the user
   disconnecting a MIDI cable during sysex transmission.

   A real-time message can occur within a sysex message. A real-time 
   message will always occupy a full PmEvent with the status byte in 
   the low-order byte of the PmEvent message field. (This implies that
   the byte-order of sysex bytes and real-time message bytes may not
   be preserved -- for example, if a real-time message arrives after
   3 bytes of a sysex message, the real-time message will be delivered
   first. The first word of the sysex message will be delivered only
   after the 4th byte arrives, filling the 4-byte PmEvent message field.
   
   The timestamp field is observed when the output port is opened with
   a non-zero latency. A timestamp of zero means "use the current time",
   which in turn means to deliver the message with a delay of
   latency (the latency parameter used when opening the output port.)
   Do not expect PortMidi to sort data according to timestamps -- 
   messages should be sent in the correct order, and timestamps MUST 
   be non-decreasing. See also "Example" for Pm_OpenOutput() above.

   A sysex message will generally fill many PmEvent structures. On 
   output to a PortMidiStream with non-zero latency, the first timestamp
   on sysex message data will determine the time to begin sending the 
   message. PortMidi implementations may ignore timestamps for the 
   remainder of the sysex message. 
   
   On input, the timestamp ideally denotes the arrival time of the 
   status byte of the message. The first timestamp on sysex message 
   data will be valid. Subsequent timestamps may denote 
   when message bytes were actually received, or they may be simply 
   copies of the first timestamp.

   Timestamps for nested messages: If a real-time message arrives in 
   the middle of some other message, it is enqueued immediately with 
   the timestamp corresponding to its arrival time. The interrupted 
   non-real-time message or 4-byte packet of sysex data will be enqueued 
   later. The timestamp of interrupted data will be equal to that of
   the interrupting real-time message to insure that timestamps are
   non-decreasing.

/**
    Pm_Read() retrieves midi data into a buffer, and returns the number
    of events read. Result is a non-negative number unless an error occurs, 
    in which case a PmError value will be returned.

    Buffer Overflow

    The problem: if an input overflow occurs, data will be lost, ultimately 
    because there is no flow control all the way back to the data source. 
    When data is lost, the receiver should be notified and some sort of 
    graceful recovery should take place, e.g. you shouldn't resume receiving 
    in the middle of a long sysex message.

    With a lock-free fifo, which is pretty much what we're stuck with to 
    enable portability to the Mac, it's tricky for the producer and consumer 
    to synchronously reset the buffer and resume normal operation.

    Solution: the buffer managed by PortMidi will be flushed when an overflow
    occurs. The consumer (Pm_Read()) gets an error message (pmBufferOverflow)
    and ordinary processing resumes as soon as a new message arrives. The
    remainder of a partial sysex message is not considered to be a "new
    message" and will be flushed as well.
