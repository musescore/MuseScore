// CrashReportSender is a "static" class which provides an API to upload
// crash reports via HTTP(S).  A crash report is formatted as a multipart POST
// request, which contains a set of caller-supplied string key/value pairs,
// and a minidump file to upload.
//
// To use this library in your project, you will need to link against
// wininet.lib.
