This directory contains a Windows DLL interface to the LAME
encoding engine.

This DLL is compatible with the BladeEnc.dll.  
See BladeMP3EncDLL.c for details of the calling
sequence, and BladeMP3EncDLL.h for details of the
data that must be passed to the DLL.  

As of yet, there is no other documentation. 

To use this DLL as a replacement for BladeEnc.dll, you
need to populate the 'mp3' struct.  

To use more advanced features of LAME, you need to 
populate the LHV1 struct instead.

Delphi 4 Users:  Gabriel Gélin <ggelin@alapage.com> has
contributed a .PAS file, do you can access the DLL from
Delphi.   See MP3export.pas.
