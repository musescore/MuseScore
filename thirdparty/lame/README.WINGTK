===========================================================================
How to compile the MP3 frame analyzer (MP3x):
===========================================================================

You first need to get hold of the latest GTK and GLIB include files and lib
files. You can download them freely from the WINGTK project WEB site.
(see http://www.gtk.org, and click on the WINGTK link.)

Download: glib-dev-VERSION.zip, gtk+-dev-VERSION.zip and extralibs-dev-VERSION.zip
where VERSION indicates the release data, so it will look something like 20000805

unzip all three zip files in a WinGTK subdirectory, which is created from the lame
analyzer directory (for example, D:\CVS\lame\WinGtk)

You will end up with the following directory tree
  D:\CVS\lame\analyzer\WinGtk\src\glib
  D:\CVS\lame\analyzer\WinGtk\src\gtk+\glib
  D:\CVS\lame\analyzer\WinGtk\src\gtk+

Set Mp3x as your current active project, recompile everything, and you're done.

===========================================================================
How to run and use the MP3 Frame analyzer
===========================================================================

To run MP3x.exe, you need the GTK DLL files: Either instal them on your system,
or put them in the same directory mp3x.exe resides.


Example:
mp3x.exe myfile

myfile can be a mp3 file, or a wav file.
