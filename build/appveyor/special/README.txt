
WARNING:

revertToFactorySettings.bat erases all changes you have made 
to preferences, palettes, and window settings. Do not open this 
file unless you expressly want to revert these settings back to 
"Factory Settings"


CAUTION:

debugMode.bat starts MuseScore in a special mode that is 
useful for developers. Debug mode may crash more frequently 
and should not be used to create scores you care about.


INFORMATION:

The Command Prompt shortcut is supplied as a convenience. 
It starts in the current directory and may be used to start 
nightly.exe using other command-line parameters.
