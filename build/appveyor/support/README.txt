                                      CONGRATULALTIONS

You've downloaded a nightly build. This means you are interested in helping 
test the latest changes and improved future versions of MuseScore



WARNING

This is not a final or prerelease version of MuseScore. The nightly builds use
the cymbal logo to emphasis that the software is likely to crash, contain 
significant bugs, and not intended for production work. If this is not what 
you want then I recommend the stable releases at
http://www.musescore.org/



INSTRUCTIONS

To start the program open the "bin" folder and double-click on "nightly.exe".
Alternatively, click on the nightly.bat shortcut.



BUGS

Please report problems you encounter on the official MuseScore forums 
and issue tracker. For instructions see:

Thank you for your interest in MuseScore.
