Copy the post-checkout file from build/git/hooks/ into .git/hooks/ in order
for git to update mscore/revision.h with the branch number automatically when
checking out:

$ cp -p build/git/hooks/post-checkout .git/hooks/

This only needs doing once, and then removes the need to do "make revision"
manually for setting the correct revision number after doing a checkout.

This works for Linux, Windows (MinGW) and OSX.
