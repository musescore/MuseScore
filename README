      - qt4 gui lib version >= qt4.8.x

        Note that many linux distributions split packages into a user

      - CMake >= 2.4.6
      - libsndfile >= 1.0.19

Credits:
      MuseScore uses the "Emmentaler" font from the lilypond project.

      - unpack source distribution
            tar xvofj mscore-x.x.x.tar.bz2

      - make
            cd mscore-x.x.x
            make release

      if something goes wrong, then remove the whole build subdirectory
      with "make clean" and start new with "make release"

      - install as root user
            sudo make install

User Documentation:
      Look at the handbook section at http://www.musescore.org

Program Documentation:
      Type
            cd build
            make doxy

      to generate the program documentation with DoxyGen.

      Browse the documentation with your favourite html browser
      at:
            build/Doc/html/index.html


Test:
      Type
            cd build/mscore
            mscore

      to start mscore. On first invocation a demofile
      (Modeste Moussorgsky: Pictures of an exhibition: Promenade)
      is shown. You probably want to change that in the
      "preferences" dialog.
