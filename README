      Please read the file LICENSE in this directory for more
      details.

Requirements:
      - Qt version >= qt5.1.x

        Note that many linux distributions split packages into a user
        and developer package and that you need to install both.

      - ALSA Version 1.0 or newer (audio/midi input/output)
      - CMake >= 2.8.9
      - libsndfile >= 1.0.19

      - portaudio 19, required for windows version

Credits:
      MuseScore uses the "Emmentaler" font from the lilypond project.

Installation:
      - unpack source distribution
            tar xvofj mscore-x.x.x.tar.bz2

      - make
            cd mscore-x.x.x
            make release

      if something goes wrong, then remove the whole build subdirectory
      with "make clean" and start new with "make release"

      - install as root user
            sudo make install

User Documentation:
      Look at the handbook section at http://www.musescore.org

Program Documentation:
      Type
            cd build
            make doxy

      to generate the program documentation with DoxyGen.

      Browse the documentation with your favourite html browser
      at:
            build/Doc/html/index.html


Test:
      Type
            cd build.release/mscore
            ./mscore

      to start mscore. On first invocation a demofile
      is shown. You probably want to change that in the
      "preferences" dialog.

Debug:
      A debug version can be built by doing "make debug" above,
      instead of "make release".

      To test the debug version, type

            cd build.debug/mscore
            ./mscore
