# This table was created using information contained in a document entitled
# "Kenya Swahili Braille Code" (see <http://liblouis.org/braille-specs/swahili/>)
# which was derived from the Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development's Swahili
# Braille Manual: “Mwongozo wa Breli Ya Kiswahili”.
#
# The Braille code is graded into 6 grades: 1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5 and 2. This is
# in line with the Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development’s Curriculum
# Designs for Kiswahili Braille. 
#
# The Braille code in the document was adopted at a Stakeholders Workshop held
# at the Swiss Lenana Mount Hotel on 25th August 2022.
