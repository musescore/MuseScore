# "UBC" stands for "Unified Braille Code" and is a generalization of UEB.
# See https://sabrailleauthority.org.za/unified-braille-code-ubc.

# The same table is used for isiXhosa and isiZulu. IsiXhosa and
# isiZulu are two of the most widely spoken languages in South
# Africa. They belong to the Nguni language family and are mutually
# intelligible. IsiXhosa is predominent in the Eastern and Western
# Cape provinces, but is spoken across South Africa. IsiZulu is
# predominent in the KwaZulu-Natal province, but is also widely spoken
# in South Africa.
#
# The Nguni braille code is based on UEB, therefore the grade 1 system
# is identical to UEB.
#
# No additional codes such as Nemeth or computer braille codes are
# used; the unified Nguni code is used also for technical material.

# The table has been created by Christo de Klerk <cjdk@mweb.co.za>
# according to the official code for these languages under the
# auspices of and approved by the South African Braille Authority
# (SABA).

# The table is maintained by Christo de Klerk <cjdk@mweb.co.za>.
