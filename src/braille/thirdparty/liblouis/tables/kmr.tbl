# Background of this table:
#
# Since the Kurdish language was forbidden for several decades and is
# still partly forbidden, there are no generally applicable standards
# because all four parts of Kurdistan are very different. Even among
# close villages, you can see differences. Only in the last 100 years
# did the awareness of a Kurdish nation and the intellectual Kurdish
# language developed. In northern Kurdistan (south-east Turkey), the
# Kurdish dialect was crystallized from the Botan region for the
# intellectual language.
#
# Since the freedom movement of Kurdistan organized itself in all parts
# of Kurdistan and the diaspora with the idea of self-administration /
# Organisation and self-determination and promoted the intellectual
# language, the Botan dialect from Northern Kurdistan became the
# intellectual universal language everywhere in the community. This is
# also shown in text, sound, and images (books, press, media, TV, and
# radio). In Northern Kurdistan, despite the ban of the Kurdish
# language, Kurdish is taught and learned through
# self-organization. This also became the ground for the Kurdish native
# language in the schools in Rojava and the Democratic Federation of
# Northern and Eastern Syria.
#
# Despite the threat of further wars in the region, a school for the
# blind was found in Kobane in 2016, which is sponsored and supported by
# the Kobane People's Council and the city administration. The school
# for the blind, consisting of 10 pupils, developed the Braille script
# for Northern Kurdish with the support of the language and cultural
# institutes from Germany and Northern Kurdistan. They tried to keep to
# the international standards. It quickly became clear that few letters
# differ from English. This knowledge became the basis of Braille in
# Northern Kurdish and since then there have been courses for learning
# Braille in a blind school class for 10 people several hours a
# week. The pupils in the blind school class consist of both war
# veterans and blind people by birth who try to learn their native
# language and Kurdish Braille together.
#
# In cooperation with the Kurdish Institute for Science and Research
# (Kurdisches Institut für Wissenschaft und Forschung e. V) in
# Düsseldorf, Germany and the Language and Culture Institute in Amed
# (Diyarbakir), as well as the People's Council of Kobane, the standards
# developed by the school for the blind in Kobane, were adopted in 2018
# in the curricula for people with blindness.
#
# Due to the reality of the war, the work of the 10-person class has
# been suspended since October 2019. There are attempts to resume work
# as soon as possible.
#
# Imam Kahraman worked with the Kurdish Institute for Science and
# Research (Kurdisches Institut für Wissenschaft und Forschung e. V) in
# Düsseldorf translated the NVDA interface into Northern Kurdish and
# created the Liblouis table for Northern Kurdish based on Kobane's
# Braille script that was previously developed.
