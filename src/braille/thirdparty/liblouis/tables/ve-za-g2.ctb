# "UBC" stands for "Unified Braille Code" and is a generalization of UEB.
# See https://sabrailleauthority.org.za/unified-braille-code-ubc.

# Tshivenda is one of the 11 official languages of South Africa. It is
# spoken primarily in the Limpopo province.
#
# The language uses the roman alphabet and has five diacritic letters.
#
# The code was substantially modified between 2010 and 2012. The code
# was also unified according to the principles of the UEB. It has 77
# contractions and no complex rules and no shortforms. We do not use
# additional codes such as Nemeth or computer braille codes; we use
# our unified Tshivenda code also for technical material.
