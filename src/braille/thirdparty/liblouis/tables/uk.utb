# The Ukrainian alphabet has 4 letters that are not in the Russian
# alphabet, namely Є, І, Ї and Ґ. Like in ru-litbrl.ctb, the
# following definitions have dot 9 set to make them distinguishable
# from the Latin letters.
#
# The first three definitions conflict with definitions in
# ru-litbrl.ctb and need to be placed before AND after the
# "ru-litbrl.ctb" include in order for both the lower- and uppercase
# part to take precedence (see
# https://github.com/liblouis/liblouis/issues/384).
