# This table is based on information provided by Ezekiel Kumwenda, Executive
# Director of Malawi Union of the Blind, and Martin Kieti of The DAISY
# Consortium in contact with Chichewa Braille readers. According to this
# information:
#  - Chichewa (also known as Chinyanja) uses Latin script.
#  - Grade 2 braille is not used for Chichewa language.
#  - Unified English Braille has not been adopted in Malawi.
#
# The Braille code is thus most similar to Standard English Braille Grade 1
# rather than Unified English Braille Grade 1. This is a similar situation to
# Swahili (Kenya) Grade 1 code and therefore this table is based on Swahili
# (Kenya) Grade 1 table with minor differences due to different letters being
# legitimate standalone words.


# Unlike in Swahili, the letter 'u' is not a standalone word in Chichewa. These
# rules override Swahili table rules to ensure the letter 'u' is preceded by the
# letter sign when it appears on its own.
