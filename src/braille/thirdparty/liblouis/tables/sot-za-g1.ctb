# Sesotho, Setswana and Sepedi are three of the 11 official languages
# of South Africa and are mutually intelligible. Sesotho (or South
# Sotho) is spoken primarily in the Free State province of South
# Africa and is also an official language of Lesotho. Setswana is
# widely spoken in the northern provinces of South Africa and in
# Botswana. Sepedi is widely spoken in the northeastern provinces of
# South Africa.
#
# The languages use the roman alphabet and have one diacritic letter,
# š (s with caron).
#
# The languages all use the same braille code. It was developed over
# 30 years ago and after the adoption of the UEB in South Africa, the
# code was also unified according to the principles of the UEB. The
# code was developed around the structure of the language, therefore
# it is quite simple and does not require any complex rules. It has
# around 80 contractions and achieves a high degree of contraction,
# around 27%. We do not use additional codes such as Nemeth or
# computer braille codes; we use our unified Sotho code also for
# technical material.
