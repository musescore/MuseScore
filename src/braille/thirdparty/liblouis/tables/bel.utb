# The Belarusian alphabet has 2 letters that are not in the Russian
# alphabet, namely І and Ў. Like in ru-litbrl.ctb, the
# following definitions have dot 9 set to make them distinguishable
# from the Latin letters.
#
# The first definition conflicts with a definition in ru-litbrl.ctb
# and needs to be placed before AND after the "ru-litbrl.ctb" include
# in order for both the lower- and uppercase part to take precedence
# (see https://github.com/liblouis/liblouis/issues/384).
