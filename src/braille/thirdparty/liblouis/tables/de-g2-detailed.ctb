# liblouis: German Grade 2 Braille (with capitals)
#
# Das System der deutschen Blindenschrift (2015/2018)
# http://www.bskdl.org/textschrift.html
#
# Unlike `de-g2.utb` this table provides more detailed braille
# representation so back-translation is more exact. This can be
# beneficial when used with screen readers and note-takers for both
# forward and backward translation.
#
# However due to the lack of consideration for back-translation of the
# German standard for grade 2 it is nearly impossible to do proper
# back-translation of German grade 2 braille. This table is slightly
# better than `de-g2.utb` but it cannot in good conscience be
# recommended for back-translation. Use it at your own risk or help
# improving it.

# Forward translation differs from that of de-g2.utb in the following ways.
# 1. All capital letters are marked.
# 2. Accented letters are translated using de-accents-detailed.cti
#    to make the translation as detailed as possible.
# 3. "`" and "´" are translated as "'" so they won't cover other
#    characters.
