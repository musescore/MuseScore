# The Tatar braille code was created by Sharif Kalimullovich Enikeev
# and accepted in 1939. It was described in "Braille codes of the
# national languages of Russia" (a collection of materials); by
# N.D. Shaposhnikova; Moscow, 2017
# <http://liblouis.org/braille-specs/russian>.

# The Tatar braille code is based on the Russian braille and includes 6 additional letters,
# namely Ә, Җ, Ң, Ө, Ү and Һ. Like in ru-litbrl.ctb, the
# following definitions have dot 9 set to make them distinguishable
# from the Latin letters.
