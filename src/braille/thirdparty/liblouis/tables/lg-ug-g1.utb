# This table was prepared using feedback from Ugandan proof readers of the
# Luganda Bible 1968 Edition (Bible Society of Uganda, 2013) in Braille.
#
# Unable to find official documentation of Luganda Braille code at present
# but will continue to seek this.

# Luganda uses the same 26 latin letters as English plus the letter Ŋŋ (LATIN
# LETTER ENG: U+014A and U+014B). It uses the same rules as UEB except for
# this letter. In UEB it is 45-1345. In Luganda it usually appears as a pair
# but sometimes singly and in both cases it is transcribed as 1345-1245 - the
# same as the letters "ng". Backtranslation is therefore problematic but there
# seem to be predicatble patterns as to where and how it is used so that this
# table works well in both directions in most cases.

# Define Ŋŋ (LATIN LETTER ENG: U+014A and U+014B) different from UEB
lowercase ŋ 1345-1245
