# Official norwegian braille specifications are collected here:
# http://liblouis.org/braille-specs/norwegian
# This specific table combines 8 dot braille with a fallback mechanism to
# 6 dot braille in cases where a character is defined in 6 dot but not 8 dot.
# The 8 dot table is based on the document "Punkttabell for JAWS".
# The 6 dot table is based on the document "Håndbok i litterær punktskrift".

# Input is expected to be normalized to NFC (fully composed)
