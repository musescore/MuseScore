# liblouis: German Grade 0 Braille (with capitals) (unofficial and experimental)

#
# Differences between this table (de-g0-detailed.utb) and de-g0.utb:
# This table is meant to be used with screen readers and note-takers
# for both forward and backward translation.
# Forward translation in this table is designed to give as much
# information as possible in order for the result to be
# back-translatable.
# Forward translation differs from that of de-g0.utb in the following ways.
# 1. All capital letters are marked.
# 2. Accented letters are translated using de-accents-detailed.cti
#    to make the translation as detailed as possible.
# 3. "`" and "´" are translated as "'" so they won't cover other
#    characters.

# Detailed accents for better back-translation.
# e.g. without this, every instance of e with any accent will back-translate as €.

# experimental handling of apostrophe by common situations
# Definitely not perfect, but perhaps the best we can currently do.
# Should not be in the core files since patterns may vary with grade.
