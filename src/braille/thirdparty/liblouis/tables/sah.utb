# The Yakut braille code was created by Ivan Gorny (the real name is
# Ivan Nikolaevich Egorov) and accepted in 1992. It was described in
# "Braille codes of the national languages of Russia" (a collection of
# materials); by N.D. Shaposhnikova; Moscow, 2017
# <http://liblouis.org/braille-specs/russian>.

# The Yakut braille code is based on the Russian braille and includes 5 additional letters,
# namely Ҕ, Ҥ, Ө, Һ and Ү. Like in ru-litbrl.ctb, the
# following definitions have dot 9 set to make them distinguishable
# from the Latin letters.

lowercase \x04a5 134569
