liblouis 3.24.0 has been released

The liblouis developer team is proud to announce the liblouis release
3.24.0. The release is available for download at:

https://github.com/liblouis/liblouis/releases

Introduction
============

Liblouis is an open-source braille translator and back-translator. It
features support for computer, literary and math braille, supports
contracted and uncontracted translation for many, many languages [1]_.
It plays an important role in an open source accessibility stack and is
used by screenreaders such as NVDA, Orca and JAWS. A companion project
liblouisutdml [2]_ deals with formatting of braille.

Noteworthy changes in this release
==================================

This release contains major updates to Hungarian, UEB, and Chinese
bopomofo braille. Danish has been completely reworked and there is now
support for the Danish braille standard 2022. There are also some new
tables so that liblouis can now generate Georgian computer braille,
Swahili (Kenya) and Chichewa (Malawi). Aside from that there is the
usual assortment of code cleanups and bug fixes.

I'd like to thank everybody for helping to bring liblouis forward.

For a detailed list of all the changes refer to the list of closed
issues [3]_.

Braille table improvements
--------------------------

-  New grade 1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5 and 2 tables for Swahili (Kenya) and
   grade 1 table for Chichewa (Malawi) thanks to Jake Kyle, Dipendra
   Manocha and Martin Kieti.
-  Improvements to Hungarian thanks to Attila Hammer.
-  Update braille patterns of some Chinese characters and phrases in the
   Chinese bopomofo braille table thanks to Bo-Cheng Jhan.
-  Add experimental Georgian computer braille table thanks to Harris
   Mowbray and Mariam Mikiashvili.
-  Updated the Danish tables to the new 2022 Danish braille standard
   thanks to Bue Vester-Andersen.

   -  Limited contraction level (grade 2l or 1.5) is no longer part of
      the Danish braille standard 2022.
   -  There is no longer any need for "literary" tables. In Danish
      braille, capital letters are now always indicated, and steps have
      been taken in the standard to ensure better back-translation.
   -  As requested by The Danish Braille Committee, the tables for the
      1993 standard will be kept as an option for at least a year. All
      the 1993 tables have been renamed to include ":sub:`1993`" in the
      filename, so the new tables will be used as default.

-  Improvements to UEB thanks to James Bowden.

   -  Add new sign for German sharp S (ICEB July 2022)
   -  Fix a couple of acronyms which require grade 1 indicator (LLB,
      LLP)
   -  Fix placement of numeral sign in letters comma digits
   -  Review rules for "under" and "there" contractions
