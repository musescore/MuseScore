/**
 * @file fluidsynth.h
 * @brief FluidSynth is a real-time synthesizer designed for SoundFont(R) files.
 *
 * This is the header of the fluidsynth library and contains the
 * synthesizer's public API.
 *
 * Depending on how you want to use or extend the synthesizer you
 * will need different API functions. You probably do not need all
 * of them. Here is what you might want to do:
 *
 * - Embedded synthesizer: create a new synthesizer and send MIDI
 *   events to it. The sound goes directly to the audio output of
 *   your system.
 *
 * - Plugin synthesizer: create a synthesizer and send MIDI events
 *   but pull the audio back into your application.
 *
 * - SoundFont plugin: create a new type of "SoundFont" and allow
 *   the synthesizer to load your type of SoundFonts.
 *
 * - MIDI input: Create a MIDI handler to read the MIDI input on your
 *   machine and send the MIDI events directly to the synthesizer.
 *
 * - MIDI files: Open MIDI files and send the MIDI events to the
 *   synthesizer.
 *
 * - Command lines: You can send textual commands to the synthesizer.
 *
 * SoundFont(R) is a registered trademark of E-mu Systems, Inc.
