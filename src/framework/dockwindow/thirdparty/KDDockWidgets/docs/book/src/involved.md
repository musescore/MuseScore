# Get Involved

## Bug Reporting

Please submit your issue reports to our [GitHub space](https://github.com/KDAB/KDDockWidgets/issues).

When reporting bugs please make it easy for the maintainer to reproduce it. Use `examples/minimal/`
or `examples/dockwidgets/` for reproducing the problem. If you did modifications to the example
in order to reproduce then please attach the *patch* and not a picture of your changes. You can
get a patch by doing `git diff > repro.diff` at the repo root.

Also state which KDDW sha1, branch or version you're using, and which operating system.
