* v2.0.0 (05 December 2023)
  - Architecture rewrite to support more frontends besides QtWidgets and QtQuick.
    2.0 isn't very interesting for users, but will allow developers to make KDDW
    support other GUI frameworks more easily. Also QtQuick is now better integrated,
    without being shoehorned with ifdefs into the QtWidgets implementation.
    - Split into a view/controller architecture
    - Non-gui logic moved to controllers
    - Each controller has a gui counter part, implemented for each supported frontend
  - Uses nlohmann JSON library (MIT) instead of QJsonDocument, for saving/restoring layouts
  - Added Config::setStartDragDistance()
  - Removed Config::setTabbingAllowedFunc() which was already deprecated in favor of Config::setDropIndicatorAllowedFunc()

   FloatingWindows to have different window flags. For example, some having
   Qt::Tool while others having Qt::Window (#314).

 - Minimum CMake version is now 3.12.0
 - Fixed restoring of normal geometry when closing a maximized window (#259)

 - Minimum Qt version is now 5.15

* v1.4.0 (16 July 2021)
  - No longer supports Qt versions less than 5.12
  - Experimental MDI support. By using MainWindowMDI you can now have "docked" dock widgets
    which are free to be arbitrarily positioned and even overlapped inside the main window.
  - TitleBar's height is now controlled by sizeHint() instead of hardcoded.
    If you haven't overridden TitleBar or just inheriting from TitleBarWidget then there's nothing to do,
    as TitleBarWidget already reimplements sizeHint. If you're inheriting directly from TitleBar then make
    sure to provide a sizeHint.
  - Added MainWindow::closeDockWidgets()
  - Fixed crash in MainWindow::layoutEqually()
  - QtQuick: Added more declarative API
  - FloatingWindow now honours the dockwidget's max-size, if there's a single
    dock widget docked. Tabbed cases are more difficult since QStackedLayout doesn't
    propagate size constraints.
  - Added MainWindowBase::groupCountChanged()
  - Introduced Config::setDropIndicatorsInhibited(), which allows you to disable support
  for drop indicators while dragging.
  - Fixed embedding the main window into a non-kddw main window (#204, #168)
  - Fixed crash with an MFC application
  - Allows to disable translucency via the KDDW_NO_TRANSLUCENCY env var, useful
    in case running on weird Window Managers.
  - Added Flag_ShowButtonsOnTabBarIfTitleBarHidden, which can be used when using Flag_HideTitleBarWhenTabsVisible.
    The close and float buttons will be shown directly in the tab-bar.
  - Fixes persistent central frame being invisible after closing all tabs (#220)
  - Added python bindings for the InitialOption struct (#198)
  - Generate and install camelcase forwarding headers (public, exported classes)

  - Improved dragging windows across screens in mixed hdpi setups
  - Fixed Flag_NativeTitleBar not hiding the client title bars when restoring (#170)
  - Double clicking a native title bar of a Qt::Tool window will now redock the window (#173)
  - Size of FloatingWindow now accounts for the fact that it's using Flag_NativeTitleBar and
    resizes its content accordingly (#174)
  - Fixed popups on overlayed dock widgets not working
  - Don't restore maximized state when using RestoreOption_RelativeToMainWindow (#184)

* v1.3.0 (8 February 2021)

  - Fixed title bar close button enabled state not being restored with Layout saver (#137)
  - Installs a version header (kddockwidgets_version.h) that defines a version string and other useful versioning macros (#138)
  - DockWidgetBase::eventFilter() is protected instead of private (regression vs v1.1) (#148)
    It's recommended that you rebuild your application when updating KDDW, as MSVC encodes private/protected in the name mangling.
  - Fixed WASM build on Windows (#163)
  - Fixed sidebar overlay not getting hidden when clicking on the main window docking area (#157)

* v1.2.0 (17 December 2020)

    - Fixed focus scope not reacting when clicking on current tab (#71)
    - Fixed floating window borders not being rendered correctly on HDPI due to rounding errors.
