/**

There will be notes on the layout

Versions:
* dev - current working version, use it for modify
* stable - stable version of layout, don't modify it

We want to do a massive refactoring of the layout, both technical implementation and functional.
We know that the layout is a very complex subsystem and by changing it,
we can break something, make it unstable.
The idea is to have a stable version of the launch and, if necessary,
be able to easily switch to it at any time while the development version is being worked on.
