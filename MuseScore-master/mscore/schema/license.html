		<p>1. The MusicXML™ Mark (or a derivative Mark, such as MusicXML™ Plus) 
		may not be used to identify any product or service not originating from 
		or licensed by Copyright Holder without specific, written prior 
		permission. However, it is acceptable for a Contributor product or 
		service to be described as being MusicXML™-compatible, assuming that the 
		claim is true in Copyright Holder’s reasonable judgment. </p>
		<p>2. This License does not grant any rights to use any other trademarks 
		owned by Copyright Holder, including without limitation &quot;Recordare®&quot;, 
		&quot;Dolet®&quot;, and &quot;In the Beginning Was the Note®&quot;, even if such marks are 
		included in the Program. For purposes of clarification and the avoidance 
		of doubt, the trademarks &quot;Recordare®&quot;, &quot;Dolet®&quot;, and &quot;In the Beginning 
		Was the Note®&quot; must not be used to endorse or promote Contributor 
		versions of the Program without the prior written permission of 
		Copyright Holder. </p>
		<p>3. All rights not expressly granted herein by Copyright Holder with 
		respect to the MusicXML™ Mark or any other trademarks owned by Copyright 
		Holder are reserved by and to Copyright Holder.</p>
      <h3>F. GENERAL</h3>
      <p>If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under 
		applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of 
		the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action 
		by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum 
		extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.</p>
      <p>All Recipient&#39;s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails 
		to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement 
		and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after 
		becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient&#39;s rights under 
		this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution 
		of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient&#39;s 
		obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient 
		relating to the Program shall continue and survive.</p>
      <p>Recordare LLC may publish new versions (including revisions) of this 
		Agreement from time to time. Each new version of the Agreement will be 
		given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including 
		Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the 
		Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version 
		of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the 
		Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. No one 
		other than Recordare LLC has the right to modify this Agreement. Except 
		as expressly stated in Sections B and E above, Recipient receives no
