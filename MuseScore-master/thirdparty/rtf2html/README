1.  Overview

    This is RTF to HTML converter version 0.1.0.
    Copyright (C) 2003 Valentin Lavrinenko, vlavrinenko@users.sourceforge.net
    
    Its primary purpose is using by developers to add rtf to html 
    converting functionality to their projects, although, end users 
    can also find it useful.

    The main effort was made on processing the tables correctly, and it
    seems successful - all other programs I've seen do tables processing
    much worse. Moreover, at the moment, I haven't seen any file that
    displays correctly in MS Word, but crashes this program.

2.  Copying

    Distributed under LGPL license - see COPYING.LESSER, it must be 
    in the archive.


3.  Compiling

    - Under UNIX:
      Just ./configure && make && make install. The program seems
      to work much (about 2 times) faster when compiled with STLPort
      STL implementation than with the GNU one. So, you may use
      --with-stlport configure option if you have it installed.

    - Under MS Windows:
      Use MSYS/MinGW, use it the same way as in UNIX.
      No makefiles for other Win compilers are included yet, so,
      write it yourself, if you want - it isn't that hard.
      BCC is no longer supported!

4.  Installation

    No binary distribution for Unix/Linux is provided - just
    compile the program from source (see above). You can, however,
    download a binary package for MS Windows from the project page,
    http://www.sf.net/projects/rtf2html.
