Version 0.2.0 - 2007/07/29
 - Fixed configure.in
 - Rewokerd character formatting handling - it became less effective 
   in terms of output size, but more conforming to XHTML standard 
   (no cross-tags)
 - Added font size support
 - Added foreground color, backgound color and highlighting (in fact, 
   bg color too) support
 - Added fontface support
 - Fixed interparagraph spacing to resemble the rtf default one
 - Borland C++ is no longer supported
Version 0.1.1 - 2005/12/15
 - Fixed fields handling
 - Added handling for some special characters (dashes, ellipsis, etc.)
Version 0.1.0 - 2005/09/29
 - Version numbering scheme changed.
 - The code was almost completely rewritten and split into
   a number of files.
 - Now using autoconf and automake, compiling and installation under
   POSIX systems is stantard.
 - Gave up using rope, it is really slower than string here.
 - A few more bugs fixed.
Version 0.03 - 2003/12/11
 - Moved from char* to strings/ropes (ropes are 
   used only if they are available, seems they are faster).
 - Instead of reading the whole file into memory and parsing the string,
   we now read the file byte by byte. It is slower but consumes much less
   memory
 - Lots of bugs fixed
Version 0.02 - 2003/11/20
 - Code slightly optimized and made more C++-ish.
 - Moved from vectors of objects to vectors of pointers.
 - A few bugs fixed.
Version 0.01 - 2003/11/09
