ABOUT MUSESCORE PORTABLE
=========================
The MuseScore Portable Launcher allows you to run MuseScore from a removable drive whose 
letter changes as you move it to another computer, or from a local folder. The program can 
be entirely self-contained on the drive and then used on any Windows computer.

LICENSE

MuseScore is released under the GNU GPLv2 license: https://musescore.org/about/gpl
The source code for MuseScore is available from MuseScore website: https://musescore.org/download

This package's installer and launcher are released under the GPL. The launcher is generated 
by the PortableApps.com Launcher Generator, available with full source and documentation 
from https://portableapps.com/apps/development/portableapps.com_launcher
The installer is generated by the PortableApps.com Installer, available with full source

INSTALLATION / DIRECTORY STRUCTURE
===================================
By default, the program expects the following directory structure:

-\ <--- Directory with MuseScorePortable.exe
├── App\
│   ├── AppInfo\
│   └── MuseScore\
└── Data\
    ├── MuseScore4\
    └── settings\

The subfolders of -\Data\MuseScore4 (see above) are the default folders where MuseScore will 
search for user custom data, as well as the default place for the 'Save as...' dialog.

*******************************************************
** Be extremely careful when deleting such a folder: **
** first check if you saved any document inside      **
**          -\Data\MuseScore4\Scores                 **
*******************************************************

The folder -\Data\settings contains MuseScore and Qml settings, as well as custom workspaces, 
autosaved and recovered files. It also contains MuseScorePortable specific settings. This folder 
can be deleted to revert MuseScore to factory settings (note: any customization will be lost in 
that case).

MUSESCOREPORTABLE.INI CONFIGURATION
====================================
Some configuration in the PortableApps.com Launcher can be overridden by the user in an INI file 
next to MuseScorePortable.exe called MuseScorePortable.ini.
If you are happy with the default options, it is not necessary, though.  There is an example INI 
included with this package to get you started.  To use it, copy AppNamePortable.ini from this 
directory to MuseScorePortable.ini next to MuseScorePortable.exe.
The options in the INI file are as follows:

   AdditionalParameters=
   DisableSplashScreen=true
   RunLocally=false

(There is no need for an INI header in this file; if you have one, though, it won't damage anything.)

The AdditionalParameters entry allows you to pass additional command-line parameters to the 
application. Whatever you enter here will be appended to the call to MuseScore.exe. The full 
list of available options is here:
https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/command-line-options

The DisableSplashScreen entry allows you to run the launcher without the PortableApps.com splash 
screen (if present in -\App\AppInfo\Launcher) showing up. The default is false.

The RunLocally entry allows you to run the portable application from a read-only medium. This is 
known as Live mode. It copies what it needs to a temporary directory on the host computer, runs 
the application, and then deletes it afterwards, leaving nothing behind. This can be useful for 
running the application from a CD or if you work on a computer that may have spyware or viruses 
and you'd like to keep your device set to read-only. As a consequence of this technique, any 
changes you make during the Live mode session aren't saved back to your device.
The default is false.
