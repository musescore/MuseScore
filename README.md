## Building
**Read the developer handbook for a [complete build walkthrough](https://musescore.org/en/developers-handbook/compilation) and a list of dependencies.**

### Getting sources
If using git to download repo of entire code history, type:

    git clone https://github.com/musescore/MuseScore.git
    cd MuseScore

Otherwise, you can just download the latest source release tarball from https://github.com/musescore/MuseScore/releases, and then from your download directory type:

    tar xzf MuseScore-x.x.x.tar.gz
    cd MuseScore-x.x.x

### Release Build
To compile MuseScore, type:

    make release

If something goes wrong, then remove the whole build subdirectory with `make clean` and start new with `make release`.

### Running
To start MuseScore, type:

    ./build.release/mscore/mscore

The Start Center window will appear on every invocation until you disable that setting via the "Preferences" dialog.

### Installing
To install to default prefix using root user, type:

    sudo make install

### Debug Build
A debug version can be built by doing `make debug` instead of `make release`.

To run the debug version, type:

    ./build.debug/mscore/mscore

### Testing
See [mtest/README.md](/mtest/README.md) or [the developer handbook](https://musescore.org/handbook/developers-handbook/finding-your-way-around/automated-tests) for instructions on how to run the test suite.

The new [script testing facility](https://musescore.org/node/278278) is also available to create your own automated tests. Please try it out!
