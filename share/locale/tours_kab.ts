        <source>Autoplace is a new feature that automatically detects and avoids many types of collisions between elements.
    You can also manually adjust the position of autoplaced elements, or disable autoplace for selected elements.

        <source>Autoplace positions most elements according to standard music engraving practice,
    such as by moving tempo markings above other text or by shortening hairpins to avoid dynamics.
    In many cases, this means that no further adjustments will be required at all.</source>

    <message>
        <source>If necessary, you can fine-tune the position of elements by dragging, by using the cursor keys while in Edit mode (double-click),
    or by using the &quot;Offset&quot; fields in the Inspector.
    This allows you to make adjustments while leaving autoplace enabled to continue avoiding collisions.</source>

    <message>
        <source>For larger adjustments, it may be more convenient to disable autoplace for selected elements using the Inspector.
    This will remove them from collision detection and allow you to place them more freely.</source>

    and also move up and down from staff to staff.</source>
