<!--
      Part I: font list
            associate symbols (code points) with names
      If no font family is given or font family is "default" then the
      configured text style font family is used.
-->

  <font>

    <sym code="0x0394" name="triangle"/>
    <sym code="0x03bf" name="circle"/>
    <sym code="0x00f8" name="oslash"/>

    <sym code="0x266d" name="b"/>
    <sym code="0x266e" name="natural"/>
    <sym code="0x266f" name="#"/>

    <sym code="0x1d12a" name="##"/>
    <sym code="0x1d12b" name="bb"/>

<!-- this allows "b" to render as a literal when when encountered as a note name -->
    <sym value="b" class="note" name="b"/>

<!-- add "code" attributes (as for "b" and "#" above) to get these to render as flat and sharp signs -->
    <sym class="accidental" name="es"/>
    <sym class="accidental" name="is"/>
<!-- this is to render the "s" in "As" and "Es" in German -->
    <sym class="accidental" name="s"/>
<!-- change value of "code" attribute to "0x200b" (zero width space) to force Bb to render as B in German -->
    <sym class="german_B" code="0x266d" name="b"/>

    </font>

<!--
      Part II: token list
            define how the various tokens within a chord symbol should be rendered

         name     ordinary text name of token
                  multiple names may be listed to allow mseveral different tokens to render the same way
         render   this is a script that contains render commands
                  see Part III for details
-->

  <token>
    <name>t</name>
    <name>^</name>
    <render>triangle</render>
    </token>

  <token>
    <name>0</name>
    <render>oslash</render>
    </token>

  <renderRoot>:n :a m:0.5:0</renderRoot>

<!--
      Part III: chord list
            declare a list of chords to be explicitly recognized
            any chord recognized as matching something on this list
            will be rendered according to the definition in this list,
            as opposed to being rendered directly from the chord symbol as typed
            thus, it provides the ability to define overrides for rendering specific chord symbols

         id       internal chord number
                  may be omitted if you don't need compatibility with older chord description files
         name     ordinary text name of chord
                  multiple names can be used to allow several different representations of the same chord
                  but there is no need to list the most common variations like "CMaj7" versus "Cma7"
                  the need for multiple names comes in if you want
                  significantly different ways of entering the same chord
                  so listing "mi7b5" and "07" as aliases for the same (half-diminished) chord
                  would allow them to be recognized as equivalent
         render   this is a script which contains render commands
                  commands:
                        xxx         draw symbol name xxx
                        m:x:y       add x:y to current position (1/5 spatium units)
                        :push
                        :pop
                        :n          root or base note
                        :a          accidental
                  if omitted, chord will be rendered directly from the first name listed above
                  so you can get all major seventh chords to render as "ma7" by creating a chord definition
                  with no id or render tag, and just the single name "ma7"
