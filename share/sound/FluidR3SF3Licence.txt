I hereby release Fluid under the MIT license, as described in below. 

Thanks to Toby Smithe for helping to get Fluid included in Ubuntu.

This package, of course, is the original Release 3 of Fluid.  


Fluid was constructed in part from samples found in the public domain that I
 edited/cleaned/remixed/programmed and largely from recordings of my own and
 in conjunction with the people below who helped along the way: 

Suren M. Seron
 Scott Hanan 
Steve Aupperle 
Chris Gillman 
Alex Taubr
 Chris Prola 
Andrew Klenk
 Winfried Hubbe 
Dylan
 Tim
 Gort 
Uros Katic 
Ethan Winer (http://www.ethanwiner.com) 


It's obviously been a few years since the project, but its nice to see that 
people are still enjoying my work and getting good use out of it.  As always,
I'd like to hear some work done with Fluid so email me, or just email me to
say hello and tell me what is going on in the computer musician world.
Who knows, maybe I'll kick start this project again? ;)
