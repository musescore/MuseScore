I hereby release Fluid under the MIT license, as described in COPYING.


Thanks to Toby Smithe for helping to get Fluid included in Ubuntu.

This package, of course, is the original Release 3 of Fluid.  


Fluid was constructed in part from samples found in the public domain that I
edited/cleaned/remixed/programmed and largely from recordings of my own and
in conjunction with the people below who helped along the way:

Suren M. Seron
Scott Hanan
Steve Aupperle
Chris Gillman
Alex Taubr
Chris Prola
Andrew Klenk
Winfried Hubbe 
Dylan
Tim
Gort
Uros Katic 
Ethan Winer (http://www.ethanwiner.com) 


It's obviously been a few years since the project, but its nice to see that
people are still enjoying my work and getting good use out of it.  As always,
I'd like to hear some work done with Fluid so email me, or just email me to
say hello and tell me what is going on in the computer musician world.
Who knows, maybe I'll kick start this project again? ;)
