    <Text>To make a single selection, click the element you want to select.
    It becomes highlighted to indicate that it is selected.
    You can use the left and right cursor keys to move the selection through the notes and rests of your score.
    Tip: if you press the "Alt" key ("Option" on macOS) along with the cursor keys you can move through other elements too,
    and also move up and down from staff to staff.</Text>

    <Text>Another way to make selections is to hold "Shift" while dragging.
