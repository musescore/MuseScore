FONTLOG for the Leland fonts
============================

This file provides detailed information on the Leland Font Software. This information should be distributed along with the Leland fonts and any derivative works.

The Leland Font Software is a family consisting of two fonts, Leland and Leland Text.


Basic font information
----------------------

Leland is a Unicode typeface designed by MuseScore BVBA for its music notation and scoring applications.

It is compliant with version 1.4 of the Standard Music Font Layout (SMuFL), a community-driven standard for how music symbols should be laid out in the Unicode Private Use Area (PUA) in the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP) for compatibility between different scoring applications.

The latest version of the SMuFL specification can be found at:

https://w3c.github.io/smufl/gitbook/


Note for developers
-------------------
If you are intending to use Leland as part of your own software application and would like advice on how best to use it, please first refer to the SMuFL specification for useful information about how Leland's glyphs are registered.
