# Standard Music Font Layout (SMuFL)

SMuFL is a specification that provides a standard way of mapping the thousands of musical symbols required by conventional music notation into the Private Use Area in Unicodeâ€™s Basic Multilingual Plane for a single (format-independent) font.

The goal of SMuFL is to establish a new standard glyph mapping for musical symbols that is optimised for modern font formats and that can be adopted by a variety of software vendors and font designers, for the benefit of all users of music notation software.

This repository is maintained by the [W3C Music Notation Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/music-notation/), and holds the latest release of the Standard Music Font Layout (SMuFL) specification. Please consult that page for further details. The group is chaired by Michael Good, Adrian Holovaty, and Daniel Spreadbury.
