## History

In **1999-2000**, **URW++ Design and Development GmbH** released the Type 1 implementations of the **Core 35** fonts under the GNU General Public License (GPL) and the Aladdin Ghostscript Free Public License (AFPL). In **2009**, URW++ additionally released the same fonts under the LaTeX Project Public License (LPPL).

In **2016**, URW++ released a **major Version 2.0** upgrade to the Core 35 fonts. This version is an extensive reworking of the original Core 35 fonts, with improved font outlines, and greatly extended character sets, including Cyrillic and Greek. Also, some font names have been changed. Version 2.0 is released in Type 1, OpenType-CFF and OpenType-TTF formats. URW++ released the Version 2.0 of the fonts under the GNU Affero General Public License, Version 3 ([AGPL](./COPYING)) with an [exemption](./LICENSE). 

In **2017**, URW++ additionally released the same Version 2.0 fonts under the LaTeX Project Public License ([LPPL](./LICENSE.LPPL)) Version 1.3c, and under the SIL OpenFont License ([OFL](./LICENSE.OFL)), Version 1.1, without a "Reserved Font Name" clause. 

In **2020**, MuseScore BVBA released the Edwin font family, a renamed version of the **C059** font family (Roman, Italic, Bold & Bold-Italic) from the **Core 35** font set. This was done in order to make modifications that suit the requirements of the open source notation software, **MuseScore**.
