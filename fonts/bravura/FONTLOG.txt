FONTLOG for the Bravura font
============================

This file provides detailed information on the Bravura Font Software. This information should be distributed along with the Bravura fonts and any derivative works.

The Bravura Font Software is a family consisting of two fonts, Bravura and Bravura Text.


Basic font information
----------------------
Bravura is a Unicode typeface designed by Steinberg for its in-development music notation and scoring application.

It is compliant with version 1.2 of the Standard Music Font Layout (SMuFL), a community-driven standard for how music symbols should be laid out in the Unicode Private Use Area (PUA) in the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP) for compatibility between different scoring applications.

More information about Steinberg's scoring application can be found at:

http://www.steinberg.net/

The latest version of the SMuFL specification can be found at:

https://w3c.github.io/smufl/gitbook/


Note for developers
-------------------
If you are intending to use Bravura as part of your own software application, please refer to the SMuFL specification for useful information about Bravura's metrics and how glyphs are registered:

23 June 2014 (Daniel Spreadbury) Bravura 1.02
– Corrected the accidentalSims12Down glyph, which had inadvertently been replaced with the accidentalSims6Down glyph

22 July 2014 (Daniel Spreadbury) Bravura 1.03
– Reduced the size of the augmentationDot glyph (now 2/5 spaces in diameter rather than 1/2 space), and likewise reduced the size of the staccato articulations (now 1/3 space in diameter rather than 1/2 space)

25 July 2014 (Daniel Spreadbury) Bravura 1.05
– Corrected the side-bearings of the timeSigParensLeft, timeSigParensRight, timeSigParensLeftSmall and timeSigParensRightSmall glyphs; also made the curvature of the small parentheses less extreme
– Added new timeSigBracketLeft, timeSigBracketRight, timeSigBracketLeftSmall, timeSigBracketRightSmall and timeSigSlash glyphs, in a new range at U+EC80 (the first new range of recommended glyphs to be added after SMuFL version 1.0)

26 August 2014 (Daniel Spreadbury) Bravura 1.06
– Corrected the registration of flag64thDownStraight.
– Corrected the appearance of U+1D1A9 in the Unicode Musical Symbols Range: it should have been equivalent to csymHalfDiminished, but it was incorrectly mapped to csymDiminished.

16 October 2014 (Daniel Spreadbury) Bravura 1.07
– Corrected the appearance of articMarcatoBelow, which was incorrectly flipped horizontally.
– Updated flag8thUp, flag8thDown, flag16thUp, and flag16thDown to be 3¼ spaces in length (previously 2¾ spaces), in keeping with the recommendations for flag length in Gould and Ross.
– Updated the glyphs in the 'Individual notes' (U+E1D0–U+E1EF) and 'Beamed groups of notes' (U+E1F0–U+E20F) such that notes have stem lengths of 2¾ spaces in length (previously 3½ for 'Individual notes', and inconsistently around 2¾ spaces in length for 'Beamed groups of notes'). These glyphs are intended to be used in close proximity to text set in other fonts, and the shorter stems provide a more harmonious appearance with typical text fonts.

5 November 2014 (Daniel Spreadbury) Bravura 1.08
– Improved versions of G, F, and C clefs, and all their variants, including the forms with ligated numbers; thanks to Tucker Meyers.
– Improved versions of the octave markers (8, 8va, 8vb, et al); thanks to Tucker Meyers.
– Improved versions of the tuplet digits (0–9, plus colon); thanks to Tucker Meyers.

11 December 2014 (Daniel Spreadbury) Bravura 1.10
– Reworked the octave markers, so that the glyphs for raising and lowering by one, two, and three octaves use the correct abbreviations with appropriate placement (superscript for pitches to be raised, at the baseline for pitches to be lowered); added new '8vb', '15mb' and '22mb' glyphs, even though these abbreviations for lowering by one, two, and three octaves are incorrect; added 'loco' and 'basso' glyphs.

7 January 2015 (Daniel Spreadbury) Bravura 1.12
– Added Hauptrhythmus (RH) and Choralmelodie (CH) glyphs, plus stylistic alternate for Hauptrhythmus(R), as used by Alban Berg.

To produce e.g. the 3/4 ligature, the string "timeSigCombNumerator timeSig3 timeSigCombDenominator timeSig4" should be used. These ligatures provide correct alignment of the numerator and denominator digits relative to each other.
– Improved metadata for flat-like accidentals, adding 'cutOutSE' points for more of them.
– Added new 'noteheadOrigin' point to metadata to assist in the alignment of noteheads of different rhythmic values, e.g. the double whole note (breve) with two vertical lines to either side of the oval notehead.
– Added new 'opticalCenter' point to metadata for dynamics glyphs, to assist in their correct alignment with noteheads and stems.

26 February 2015 (Daniel Spreadbury) Bravura 1.15
– Improved U+EB2A (elecPowerOnOff) so that it more closely matches the standard appearance of the IEEE 5009 symbol.
– Improved consistency of registration of U+EB2E–U+EB33 (elecVolumeLevel...) glyphs.
– Corrected typo in metadata for dynamicSforzadoFF glyph.
– Improved U+E26A (accidentalParensLeft) and U+E26B (accidentalParensRight).
– Fixed contour direction for many glyphs; this may have resulted in incorrect appearance of some glyphs in some display contexts, and when printed on some printers.
– Resized all notehead glyphs, except for those in the 'Note name noteheads' (U+E150–U+E1AF), 'Individual notes' (U+E1D0–U+E1EF), and 'Beamed groups of notes' (U+E1F0–U+E20F) ranges, such that they are exactly 0.25 em (equivalent to one staff space) in height; previously, many of the notehead glyphs had been optically sized and were taller.
– Added a new stylistic set (ss05) containing optically-sized versions of the most common noteheads (double whole, square double whole, whole, half, and black). These glyphs are oversized, and are designed to be the largest possible noteheads that will work with staff lines of the thickness recommended in the Bravura font-specific metadata.
– Many glyphs have small improvements to outline quality (via 'checkOutlines -i -e' from the Adobe FDK).

14 April 2015 (Daniel Spreadbury) Bravura 1.16
– Improved versions of bold dynamics characters; thanks to Tucker Meyers.
– Improved versions of keyboard pedalling characters; thanks to Tucker Meyers.
– Improved versions of trill, turn etc. characters; thanks to Tucker Meyers.
– Improved symmetry of the whole note name noteheads; removed counters from noteWholeEmpty and noteHalfEmpty, since these are designed to be printed in white underneath note name noteheads, so that stave lines and ledger lines are blanked out, making the note names in the counters of the note name noteheads clearer to read.
– Corrected side-bearings on Sagittal accidentals.
– Corrected registration of glyphs designed to be combined with stems (descriptions ending '...for stem'), now consistently visually centered around both x=0 and y=0.
– Corrected vertical registration of precomposed square (U+E120, U+E121), round (U+E122, U+E123), and diamond (U+E138–U+E13B) cluster noteheads, so they are consistent with the cluster notehead components in the same range.
