FONTLOG for the Bravura font
============================

This file provides detailed information on the Bravura Font Software.
This information should be distributed along with the Bravura fonts
and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information
----------------------
Bravura is a Unicode typeface designed by Steinberg for its
in-development music notation and scoring application.

It is compliant with version 0.4 of the Standard Music Font Layout
(SMuFL), a community-driven standard for how music symbols should be
laid out in the Unicode Private Use Area (PUA) in the Basic
Multilingual Plane (BMP) for compatibility between different scoring
applications.
