# Bravura music font

Bravura is an OpenType music font developed for Steinberg's [Dorico](https://www.steinberg.net/dorico) music notation and composition software.

It is also the reference font for [Standard Music Font Layout (SMuFL)](https://w3c.github.io/smufl/gitbook/), which provides a standard way of mapping the thousands of musical symbols required by conventional music notation into the Private Use Area in Unicodeâ€™s Basic Multilingual Plane for a single (format-independent) font.
