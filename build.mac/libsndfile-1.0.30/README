LINUX
-----
Whereever possible, you should use the packages supplied by your Linux
distribution.

If you really do need to compile from source it should be as easy as:

		./configure
		make
		make install

Since libsndfile optionally links against libFLAC, libogg, libvorbis and
libopus, you will need to install appropriate versions of these libraries
before running configure as above.

You can use CMake now to build under Linux, also under Windows and MacOS, see
README.md for details. CMake toolchain is usable, but still exterimental.


UNIX
----
Compile as for Linux.


Win32/Win64
-----------

Official Windows binaries are compiled with Autotools and MinGW, but you can use
CMake to generate solution for Visual Studio. Details are described in
README.md.

It is still recommended to use the libsndfile binaries available on the
libsndfile web site.

MacOSX
------
Building on MacOSX should be the same as building it on any other Unix.
