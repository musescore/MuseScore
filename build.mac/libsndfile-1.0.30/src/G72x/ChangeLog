	* g72x.c
	Added {} in function update () to prevent 'ambiguous else' warning messages.

	* g72x.c
	Modified g72x_init_state () to fit in with the new structure of the code.
	Implemented g72x_encode_block () and g72x_decode_block ().

    * g72x.h
    Moved nearly all definitions and function prototypes from this file have been 
    moved to private.h.
    Added an enum defining the 4 different G72x ADPCM codecs.
    Added new function prototypes to define a cleaner interface to the encoder 
    and decoder. This new interface also allows samples to be processed in blocks
    rather than on a sample by sample basis like the original code.
    
    * private.h
    Added prototypes moved from g72x.h.
    Changed struct g72x_state to a typedef struct { .. } G72x_PRIVATE.
    Added fields to G72x_PRIVATE required for working on blocks of samples.

    * g72x.c
    Fixed all compiler warnings.
    Removed functions tandem_adjust() which is not required by libsndfile.
    
    * g721.c
    Fixed all compiler warnings.
    Removed functions tandem_adjust_alaw() and tandem_adjust_ulaw () which are not 
    required by libsndfile.
    Removed second parameter to g721_encoder () which is not required.

    * g72x.h
    Removed in_coding and out_coding parameters from all functions. These allowed
    g72x encoding/decoding to/from A-law or u-law and are not required by libsndfile.
    Removed unneeded defines for A-law, u-law and linear encoding.

    * g723_16.c
    Removed second parameter (in_coding) for g723_16_encoder().    
    Removed second parameter (out_coding) for g723_16_decoder().
    
    * private.h
    New file containing prototypes and tyepdefs private to G72x code.
