The real Aeolus can be found at

      http://www.kokkinizita.net/linuxaudio/

The code in this directory is heavily modified and contains
basically only the aeolus synthesizer engine, modified to fit
into the MuseScore framework.

All bugs are most likely introduced by me and if you
find one please donâ€™t bother Fons Adriaensen with it.
